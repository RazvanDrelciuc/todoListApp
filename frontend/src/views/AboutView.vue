              <v-list-item-title>Technology:</v-list-item-title>
              <v-list-item-subtitle>The backend should be developed using plain PHP, leveraging the capabilities of
                Object-Oriented Programming extensively. Avoid using any PHP frameworks to ensure the use of raw PHP
                skills.

              </v-list-item-subtitle>
            </v-list-item>

            <v-list-item>
              <v-list-item-title>REST API:</v-list-item-title>
              <v-list-item-subtitle>Implement a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for tasks. This API will serve as
                the interface for the frontend to interact with the backend.
              </v-list-item-subtitle>
            </v-list-item>

            <v-list-item>
              <v-list-item-title>Database:</v-list-item-title>
              <v-list-item-subtitle>Use SQL for data storage, employing PHP Data Objects (PDO) for database interactions
                to prevent SQL injection and ensure secure database queries.

              <v-list-item-subtitle>Focus on implementing robust security measures, such as sanitizing inputs,
                validating data, and using prepared statements for database interactions. Optimize performance through
                efficient query design and minimizing server response times.

              <v-list-item-title>Functionality:</v-list-item-title>
              <v-list-item-subtitle>The frontend should support adding, editing, and deleting tasks. It must be
                intuitive and user-friendly, with minimalistic design elements that focus on usability.

          <p>The aim is to create a functional and secure todo-list application that demonstrates your ability to work
            with both backend and frontend technologies in a real-world project setting. The application should not only
            fulfill the technical requirements but also deliver a seamless and engaging user experience.</p>
          <p>Additionally, employing advanced techniques such as application containerization, thorough documentation,
            and adherence to industry best practices throughout the development process will be considered a significant
            advantage. These elements will showcase your comprehensive skills in modern software development and your
            commitment to producing high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software.</p>
